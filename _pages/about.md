My research centers on trade-based money laundering and how to detect it using machine learning, with a particular focus on graph-based machine learning approaches. I have a varied background in computer science, finance, anti-money laundering, and natural language processing. 

My PhD project, _Detecting Trade Based Money Laundering through Machine Learning_, is funded by the [Innovation Fund Denmark](https://innovationsfonden.dk/en). At [UCPH](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/machine-learning/), I'm supervised by [Oswin Krause](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/440348) and [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/). At the [Danish Finance Intelligence Unit](https://hvidvask.dk/en), I'm supervised by Dorte Hermansen.
