My research centers on trade-based money laundering and how to detect it using machine learning, with a particular focus on graph-based machine learning approaches. I have a varied background in computer science, finance, anti-money laundering, and natural language processing. 

My PhD project, _Detecting Trade Based Money Laundering through Machine Learning_, is funded by the [https://innovationsfonden.dk/en](Innovation Fund Denmark). At UCPH, I'm supervised by [https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/440348] (Oswin Krause) and [https://raghavian.github.io/] Raghavendra Selvan). At the Danish Finance Intelligence Unit, I'm supervised by Dorte Hermansen.
